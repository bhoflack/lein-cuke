Feature: Leave this feature unimplemented
  So that I may drive the development of lein cuke
  As a busy Behavior Driven Developer
  I want to leave this as an unimplemented feature

  Scenario: This feature should remain unimplemented
    Given I have installed lein-cuke
    When I leave this feature unimplemented
    Then my tests should pass
